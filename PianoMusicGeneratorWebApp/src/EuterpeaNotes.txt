Euterpea is a library for music composition and analysis in Haskell. It provides a framework for creating, 
manipulating, and analyzing music in a functional programming context. Euterpea's key features are:

Music Representation: Euterpea defines a Music data type, which is a versatile representation of music. 
This type can express notes, rests, chords, sequences of musical pieces, and more. It allows for the 
creation of complex musical compositions programmatically.

Note and Pitch Representation: In Euterpea, notes are represented with pitches (like C, D, E, etc.) 
and durations (whole note, half note, etc.). This abstraction makes it easy to construct melodies and harmonies.

MIDI Integration: Euterpea can interface with MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), allowing 
music composed in Haskell to be played back through MIDI-enabled devices or software synthesizers. 
This is crucial for turning code into audible music.
