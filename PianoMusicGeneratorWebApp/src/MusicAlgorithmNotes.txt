How this program generates music:

Web Request Handling:
The getGenerateMusicR function acts as a web handler. It receives HTTP GET requests with parameters for key signature (keySignature), 
beats per minute (bpm), and time signature (timeSignature).These parameters are extracted from the request, and default values are 
used if they are not provided.

Music Composition:
The function composeMelodyAndBass is called to generate the music. This function takes a time signature, the number of measures, and 
a pitch (derived from the key signature). It creates a melody line using generateMelodyLine and a bass line using generateBassLine, 
and then combines them into a single music piece.

Melody and Bass Line Generation:

Melody Line: 
Generated by the generateMelodyLine function, which composes a melody for the specified number of measures. Each measure's melody is 
created by generateMelodyPhrase, which in turn uses generatePhrase to compose a sequence of musical notes based on a scale derived 
from the initial pitch.

Bass Line: Generated by generateBassLine, which utilizes a random chord progression (randomProgression) and the major scale (majorScale)
based on the initial pitch. This function creates a series of bass notes that align with the chosen chord progression.

Chord Progressions:
The randomProgression function selects a random chord progression from a predefined list (progressions). These progressions are common
patterns used in music composition.

Playing Music:
Once the music piece is composed, it is played by the playMusicWithTempo function. This function adjusts the tempo of the music based 
on the provided BPM and then plays the combined melody and bass line.
