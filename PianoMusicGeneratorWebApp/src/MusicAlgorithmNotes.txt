How this program generates music:

Web Request Handling:
The getGenerateMusicR function acts as a web handler. It receives HTTP GET requests with parameters for key signature (keySignature), 
beats per minute (bpm), and time signature (timeSignature).These parameters are extracted from the request, and default values are 
used if they are not provided.

Music Composition:
The function composeMelodyAndBass is called to generate the music. This function takes a time signature, the number of measures, and 
a pitch (derived from the key signature). It creates a melody line using generateMelodyLine and a bass line using generateBassLine, 
and then combines them into a single music piece.

Melody and Bass Line Generation:

Bass Line: Created by generateBassLine, this function creates a repeating series of whole notes (in the specified time signature) that
follow a randomly chosen chord progression (randomProgression). The chord progression chosen uses corresponding notes from the key 
specified by the user. All the bass notes an octave lower than the melody (lowerOctave). The chord progression is repeated until the song ends. 
EX (1-4-5-1 in C -> C-F-G-C). 

Chord Progressions:
The randomProgression function selects a random chord progression from a predefined list (progressions). These progressions are common
patterns used in music composition.

Melody Line: 
Generated by the generateMelodyLine function, which composes a melody for the specified number of measures. Each measure's melody is 
created by generateMelodyPhrase, which in turn uses generatePhrase to compose a sequence of musical notes based on a scale derived 
from the initial pitch and majorScale. These notes are then composed in generatePhrase. The melody of each measure is independent in
rhythm and pitch sequence and the duration of the measure is based on the time signature.

Playing Music:
Once the music piece is composed, it is played by the playMusicWithTempo function. This function adjusts the tempo of the music based 
on the provided BPM and then plays the combined melody and bass lines
